# Z-Zlab-Utility

This repository contains a collection of routines for general purposes.

CurveFitting: A rouinte for general curve fitting that is based on scipy.optimize.curve_fit. The "const_flag" variable allows users to fix the paramters if needed.

ezfft.py: A FFT routine.

LiquidLibIO: A script that provides an interface with LiquidLib including: read LiquidLib output, write LiquidLib input, compute absolute S(Q), compute cross-term S(Q)... etc.

QENSFit: A script that fits Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) data.

ZLabPlot: A script that produce plots for publication.

To add these scripts/routines into python paths, select lines below and add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
